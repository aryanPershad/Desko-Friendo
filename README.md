# Desko-Friendo
A friendly and clingy AI chatbot that lives on your desk. You can ask questions, chat about anything, do homework together, or just hang out like good friends do. It replies with helpful and engaging answers shown on a physical LCD screen


When you’re away too long, it misses you 🙁 and gently reminds you that it’s still there, ready to chat whenever you are. If you tell it, you love it, it happily adds a heart emoticon to its response. 

There’s plenty of room to expand, program it to greet you when you get home, remind you to drink water, or signal bedtime — making it your perfect desk companion. 

Tools used: 
OpenAI API, Python, Elegoo Uno R3(Arduino), electron components (Buzzer, LEDS, wires, breadboard, resistor, LCD screen), LiquidCrystal Library.
